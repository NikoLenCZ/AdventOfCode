# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my repository for solving puzzles from [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)!
I will be solving these puzzles using JavaScript.

## 🌟 About

Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge that takes place in December. Each day, a new programming puzzle is released, and participants try to solve it using the programming language of their choice.

## ✨ Structure

This repository is organized by day, with each day's solution contained in its own folder:

```
/day01
/day02
...
/day25
```

Each folder contains the following files:
- `input.txt`: The puzzle input for the day.
- `solution.js`: The solution code for the day.
- `README.md`: Explanation of the solution and approach.

## 💫 How to Run

To run the solutions, navigate to the respective day's folder and execute the solution file. For example:

```sh
cd day01
node solution.js
```
